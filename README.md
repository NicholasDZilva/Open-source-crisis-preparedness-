# Open Source Crisis Preparedness

This repository hosts the full paper **Open Source Crisis Preparedness**, a structural framework for crisis management that emphasizes transparency, community participation, and baseline preservation.

## Abstract

Current crisis response models — for pandemics, cyber attacks, financial shocks, or other cascading emergencies — are almost entirely pre-designed by centralized institutions. While these frameworks appear comprehensive, they structurally consolidate authority, resources, and decision-making power, often eroding human agency and community adaptability.

This paper proposes **open source crisis preparedness**: a system where regular people, experts and non-experts alike, can submit, share, and iterate on crisis response solutions openly. By enabling participation from those directly affected, optionality, adaptability, and baseline preservation are maintained.

A single independent actor, without institutional backing, demonstrated the potential of this approach by designing a cascading cyber attack response using **trade vouchers** and **local community verification hubs** — a simple, coherent alternative to complex centralized models.

## Key Concepts

- **Baseline Preservation:** Maintaining recoverable reference states and human agency during crises.
- **Optionality:** Ensuring multiple viable pathways exist, preventing lock-in to brittle solutions.
- **Constituency Inversion:** Communities affected by a crisis become the validators of institutional plans, enforcing accountability.
- **Side-by-Side Transparency:** Community-generated solutions sit alongside institutional proposals, forcing explicit justification and structural comparison.
- **Iterative Open Source Solutions:** Platforms enable submission, review, and improvement of ideas, creating a living knowledge base for crisis response.

## Real-World Precedents

- **Event 201 (Oct 2019):** Pandemic simulation emphasizing institutional continuity, centralizing decision authority.
- **COVID-19 Response:** Official responses mirrored centralized assumptions, often at the cost of baseline resilience.
- **Cyber Polygon & Cascading Cyber Risks:** Simulated centralized responses contrast sharply with simple problem-space solutions like trade vouchers and community verification hubs.

## Platform Design Principles

1. **Accessibility for Problem-Space Actors:** Anyone experiencing the problem can submit proposals.
2. **Transparent Submission & Verification:** Contributions are timestamped, visible, and peer-validated.
3. **Iterative Evolution:** Solutions evolve with feedback from experts and non-experts, preserving coherence and optionality.

## Advantages Over Centralized Models

| Feature                | Centralized Crisis Models | Open Source Crisis Preparedness |
|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Decision Authority     | Institutions            | Affected community            |
| Optionality            | Low                     | High                          |
| Baseline Preservation  | Secondary               | Primary                        |
| Innovation             | Limited                 | Distributed & emergent        |
| Verification           | Centralized             | Distributed & peer-validated  |
| Accountability         | Weak                    | Structural: constituency inversion |

## Expert Integration

This framework does **not replace technical expertise**. Instead, expert and community-generated solutions are presented **side by side**, ensuring that institutions must justify their choices while protecting baseline and optionality.

## Author Perspective

Conceptualized and developed **outside institutional channels**, by someone living in the problem space. Demonstrates that coherent, baseline-preserving crisis solutions can emerge from independent actors without formal qualifications.
